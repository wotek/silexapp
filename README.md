# SilexApp

An example app that is just a dummy in order to setup proper dev pipeline with deployments.

# Installation

It uses docker, so I assume you got it in your system. If so just type:

```sh
make build
make run
```

That will setup all you need. App will be present under `8080` on localhost.
